## What is this?

This is just a quick demo of building a TodoMVC-style app in Angular 2
that I used when giving a talk to [Angular JS Utah](https://github.com/AngularJSUtah) on 9 February 2016.

It's heavily inspiried by a tutorial John Lindquist of [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/)
made as a video series as well as my own experience prototyping Angular 2
apps. Nobody's going to pretend that it's a production grade sample,
but it shows the core tenents of building an Angular app.

Want to follow along? Check out the following tags for building the app in stages!

- `step-0` - Basic boilerplate
- `step-1` - The app templates and bootstraps
- `step-2` - Refactoring data access into an injectable service
- `step-3` - Refactoring our todos into a model and a renderer component
- `step-4` - Filtering our todos based on their completeness
- `step-5` - Making the pipe configurable, and presenting a UI for this
